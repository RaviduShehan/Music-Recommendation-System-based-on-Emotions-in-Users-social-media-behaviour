This is my final year research project which developed using Python
Project consist with 3 models, Text analysing in English and sinhala as well as lyrics analysation
To run this, you need to get the twitter APK and add the relevent details on app.py.
Also you need to get the 1million word vector to train the model.
You can get the word vectors from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html
