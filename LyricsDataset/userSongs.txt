Gotta take my chance tonight

I should have known better with a girl like you That I would love everything that you do And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do  Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be This could only happen to me Can't you see, can't you see That when I tell you that I love you, oh You're gonna say you love me too, oh And when I ask you to be mine You're gonna say you love me too  So I should have realized a lot of things before If this is love you've got to give me more Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more  Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be This could only happen to me Can't you see, can't you see  That when I tell you that I love you, oh You're gonna say you love me too, oh And when I ask you to be mine You're gonna say you love me too You love me too, you love me too You love me too.

   It starts with One thing I don't know why It doesn t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It s so unreal Didn t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on but didn t even know I wasted it all just to watch you go  I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...  I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter  One thing, I don t know why It doesn t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I m surprised it got so (far) Things aren t the way they were before You wouldn t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me In the end  You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...  I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn t even matter  I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There s only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There s only one thing you should know  I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn t even matter.

   We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before Now today I find you have changed your mind Treat me like you did the night before  Were you telling lies, ah, the night before? Was I so unwise, ah, the night before? When I held you near you were so sincere Treat me like you did the night before  Last night is a night I will remember you by When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry  We said our goodbye, ah, the night before Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before Now today I find you have changed your mind Treat me like you did the night before  Yes  When I held you near you were so sincere Treat me like you did the night before  Last night is a night I will remember you by When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry  Were you telling lies, ah, the night before? Was I so unwise, ah, the night before? When I held you near you were so sincere Treat me like you did the night before Like the night before

  	Cry baby cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better  The king of Marigold was in the kitchen Cooking breakfast for the queen The queen was in the parlour Playing piano for the children of the king  Cry baby cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better So cry baby cry  The king was in the garden Picking flowers for a friend who came to play The queen was in the playroom Painting pictures for the childrens holiday  Cry baby cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better So cry baby cry  The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling And arriving late for tea The duke was having problems With a message at the local bird and bee  Cry baby cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better So cry baby cry  At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table For a seance in the dark With voices out of nowhere Put on specially by the children for a lark  Cry baby cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better Cry baby cry  Cry cry cry Make your mother sigh She's old enough to know better So cry baby cry.

      God bless us everyone, We're a broken people living under loaded gun. And it can't be outfought, It can't be outdone, It can't be outmatched, It can't be outrun. No!  And when I close my eyes tonight, To symphonies of blinding light!  God bless us everyone, We're a broken people living under loaded gun. Oh!  Like memories in cold decay, Transmissions echoing away, Far from the world of you and I, Where oceans bleed into the sky! God save us everyone, Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns? For the sins of our hands, The sins of our tongues, The sins of our fathers, The sins of our young. No!  And when I close my eyes tonight, To symphonies of blinding light!  God save us everyone, Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?  Ooh!  Like memories in cold decay, Transmissions echoing away, Far from the world of you and I, Where oceans bleed into the sky!  Oh! Like memories in cold decay, Transmissions echoing away, Far from the world of you and I, Where oceans bleed into the sky.    Lift me up, Let me go...  God bless us everyone, We're a broken people living under loaded gun And it can't be outfought, It can't be outdone, It can't be outmatched, It can't be outrun. No! God bless us everyone, We're a broken people living under loaded gun. And it can't be outfought, It can't be outdone, It can't be outmatched, It can't be outrun.
